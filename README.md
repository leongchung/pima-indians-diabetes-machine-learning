# Overview

The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset presents a binary classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes (Outcome = 1) or not (Outcome = 0) based on medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, and number of pregnancies.

This is a supervised learning task, with labeled data, aiming to build a model that can generalize well and assist in early diabetes detection.
